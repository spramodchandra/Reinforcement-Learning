# Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains implementations of different reinforcement learning techinques like dynamic programming, monte carlo, temporal differencing.

All these implemention takes input.txt as an input.
<br/>Input description
<br/>first line: grid size
<br/>second line: no of obstacles n
<br/>next n lines: obstacles locations
<br/>next line: robot starting position
<br/>nextline: robot ending position

<br/>Rewards:
<br/>for each move get -1 reward
<br/>when u reach destination we get 100 reward
<br/>when u enter an obstacles we get -100 reward
<br/>
The main goal in reinforecement learning is to find a path which maximizes rewards earned.
